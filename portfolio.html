          <p>Recreated my Switch in Blender to go with the Kirby Amiibo. The controllers and the body of the switch were all created seperatly so that it is just as versitile in the virtual realm as the actual device is in reality. The completed switch at the bottom has the controller colors that I personally use on my set up. </p>
