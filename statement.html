  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>I am an artist who works in the field of digital art, mostly photoshop and other similar illustrating programs, and I know a small amount of html and css coding to make basic websites. I have limited experience working with painting, photography, metal casting/smithing, and other basic sculpture techniques. I hope to soon branch out into 3D modeling because a passion of mine is videogames and I hope to one day create concept art in that industry. I create art because I find it fun, I want to create things that are cool and interesting and turn it into something that other people find cool and interesting enough to want to see more of my work.</p>
  <p>Currently I am going through college to get a degree in digital media art, and one thing I have constantly heard throughout my time at school is that art should have a deeper meaning behind it; that your reason for creating something shouldn’t be just because you thought it looked neat. However, I disagree. I’ve gone through life loving art and wanting to pursue art as a career because I love creating things that look good and capture the interest of others, not necessarily because there is deep meaning and emotion behind the piece. Another thing I have enjoyed throughout life is videogames, I love playing them and seeing the dynamic and interesting worlds that others have created. My goal is to one day be a concept artist for videogames so that I too can create visually compelling and interesting worlds that others enjoying looking at and exploring.
